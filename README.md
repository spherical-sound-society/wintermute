Wintermute is a strange machine difficult to describe. It sits between a Drum Machine, a Groove Box and an experimental generative synth. It´s difficult to describe but easy to play and get unique sounding loops, crescendos and even whole sessions just from the machine.

The heart is a 4 Operators FM engine, based on some great Yamaha old chips from Arcade machines and consoles, but with a lot of twists and licences. So it sounds kind of retro and avant-garde at the same time while sounding totally different to probably any other synth. It has a clear personal mark and ultimately it sounds totally as itself.

The engine has multiple sequencers running and collapsing one versus another, using totally original algoridtms that mute, recombine and change constantly to offer fresh outputs. It´s not about playing what you want, but to discover and explore gazillions of possibilities, strange sonic landscapes and happy accidents.

Wintermute likes to be recorded, because it always sound different and probably what you are listening now is pretty much only hear this time and will be never repeated. The cool thing is that it doesnt not use randomization. It´s all algorithmic, but the possibilities change and recombine constantly with every turn of the pots therefore is pretty much irrepetible.

Wintermute has reached maturity and it´s releasing in version 1.0, but as the outputs of the machine itself, will evolve with different firmwares taking different branches and structures of creation, as the possibilities of expanding and muting how you play it are vasts and infinites and we love to give quite different firmwares to every machine. The coming versions will be free for customers as long as we don't rewrite the code from the ground and produce a totally different animal.

You better listen to the video demos to grasp an idea.
